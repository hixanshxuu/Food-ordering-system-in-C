# Food-ordering-system-in-C
A full fledged working code in C language for a fast food ordering system with a generated invoice/bill. It uses the simple concept of file handling in C language, creating a master file and being able to read, write, modify, alter and delete the file too. 
The code runs smoothly nd has a home page with the current date and time according to your system time and date. It has total 6 options including threee times meals and a third option for displaying all the bills from the master file named as "players", and deleting some bills from their invoice numbers and also the last option as exit. 
As soon as you select any meal from brealfast, lunch or dinner menu, you are asked if you want to select more than one item and then according to the user input the orders are processed and then the total bill is generated, username is asked, take away, dine in or home delivery options come along before the final bill is generated.
The final bill that is genetated contains the information of the total price, the paid price, the change left to handover to the customer and the curretn date and time too.
